                <h2 class="main-interface-information-section-title">Why does this tool exist and what do I use it for?</h2>
                <p class="main-interface-information-section-body">
                    I needed a tool that could help me when I want to login to some website, service or app on a public or a friend's computer, while my passwords are in the password manager on my phone (and they are way too difficult to remember, which is a good thing; please use apps like 1Password or LastPass to improve the security of your data!)
                </p>
                <p class="main-interface-information-section-body">
                    If you don't have a service like Airdrop or your devices aren't all connected to the same iCloud account, sharing data between devices can be a hassle. Most of the time you are left with painstakingly typing in your password character by character while reading it from you phone. And having to start over at least three to five times because of a typo. Even more when your add the stress of colleagues or friends looking over your shoulder.
                </p>
                <p class="main-interface-information-section-body">
                    <span class="link">CopyPaste.me</span> helps you transferring any password, texts or file from one device to another. So no more emailing yourself passwords or other things to get stuff from you phone to your computer or writing down a password on a piece of paper for a colleague or family member (don't judge :p, I think many of us have done it once or twice).

<!--                <p class="main-interface-information-section-body">-->
<!--                    Your receiving device shows a QR code. By scanning this code with, for instance, your phone, voila: a realtime connection is set up between your devices and you are ready for sharing (for people with technical knowledge: I'm connecting the two devices using socket.io). When you send your data, it's immediately forwarded to the receiving device without storing it on the server. Therefore there will be no traces of logs of what you share.</p>-->

<!--                    Exactly! Your data is yours and yours alone. This this tool is designed to work without the need to store your data. Which is good, because your data shouldn't be stored all over the internet just because you're using online tools.-->

<!--                    Don't worry. A connection only allows two devices. If another person would try to connect, your screen will show a warning about your security being compromised and the connection will immediately be terminated and no data will be sent. Your data is safe!-->

<!--                    Yes, it's totally free! And to keep it like this, I need your help! For privacy reasons I can't have advertisers (and because I really, really don't want to; that business model is broken to the core) and for long term sustainability reasons I don't want investors (profit and economic growth shouldn't be at the core of every initiative). On top of this, I don’t want intruders like that in the mix when you share data with yourself, a friend a colleague.-->
