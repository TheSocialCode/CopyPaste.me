                <span class="link">CopyPaste.me</span> helps you when you need to send a password, text snippet or file from one phone, laptop or tablet to another device. No more painstakingly typing in your password character by character, sending yourself pieces of text via email or having to look for a USB stick. As long as you have a browser, you are ready to start sharing data between devices.

If you don’t have a camera at hand, for instance whan you want to connect your laptop to another computer, simply use the <span class="highlight">`connect manually`</span> option.</p>

                Never again the desparate search for a USB-stick or someone
                from the technical desk to get files from your laptop or phone
                to a computer you need it on. Also very handy for sharing
                files or photos with people you’ve just met, but currently
                don’t have (or want to have) in your contact list.

            <div class="main-interface-information-section-body bottom">
                <p>The Social Code Foundation wants to offer this privacy-friendly sharing service free to all, but to cover the operational costs it relies on donations by enthusiastic users. For privacy reasons, and because the advertisement business model is broken to the core, the project can’t be funded with ad revenue. For long term sustainability reasons the project doesn’t want to rely on investors: profit and economic growth shouldn't be at the core of every initiative.</p>
